space-titanic

Basic Data Science Project Lifecycle:
    1. Define the Problem: Clearly understand the problem you are trying to solve and the goals of your project.
    2. Data Collection: Gather the relevant data for your project. In your case, for the "space-titanic" project,
        you may already have the dataset from Kaggle.
    3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Prepare your data for analysis. This involves handling missing values, dealing
        with outliers, and transforming data into a suitable format.
    4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore and visualize the data to gain insights and identify patterns that can
        inform your modeling approach.
    5. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the performance of your machine
        learning models.
    6. Model Building: Select and apply appropriate machine learning algorithms to train and test your models.
    7. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of your models using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
    8. Model Deployment: If applicable, deploy your model for use in a real-world setting.
    9. Documentation and Reporting: Document your process, findings, and insights in a clear and organized manner.
        This can include creating a Jupyter notebook or a report summarizing your work.

1. Define the Problem : This is given in this project. There has been a space-wreck and we are trying to predict which passengers
    were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship's damaged computer system.
2. Data Collection : This is also given. Use train.csv file for the data and test.csv for prediction.
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing : Before performing EDA, one should handle missing values and transforming data into a suitable format
    In this case, there are null-values for almost every variable.
        - 'Age' with mean, 'Name' with 'Unknown' and all others with mode
4. EDA :
    1) descriptive statistics
    2) distribution check
    3) Outlier Detection
    4) Correlation
    5) Handling missing values
    6) setup hypothesis and validating
    7) Multivariate Analysis
    8) Time analysis (if possible)
    9) report

    


data
- PassengerId: gggg_pp where gggg is the group and pp is their number within the group
- HomePlanet: Mars/Earth/Europa
- CryoSleep: Boolean variable that tells us whether the passenger was on cryosleep.
- Cabin: Cabin number. deck/num/side (side = P-port/S-starboard)
- Destination: ['TRAPPIST-1e', 'PSO J318.5-22', '55 Cancri e']
- Age: 
- VIP: Boolean variable that tells us whether the passenger paid for the VIP service during the voyage
- RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck: amount the passenger is billed
- Name: 
- Transported: Boolean variable that tells us whether the passenger was transported to different dimension


age - median 대체
출발지 목적지 등 숫자로 변경해서 평균값 삽입
(숫자로 변경하는 공식이나 방법?)

cluster를 해서 feature를 뽑는 방법
사치에 쓰는 비용

feature skew 된거를 standard scalar 써서 0-1로 노멀라이즈
스케일링 해보고 히스토그램

correlation이 높은애들은 그 한 카테고리의 비중이 치우쳐져있으면 실제 테스트할때 다른 비중이 나올경우
덜 정확할 확률이 있어서, 랜덤샘플링으로 유니폼하게 맞춰서 진행하면 좋음
